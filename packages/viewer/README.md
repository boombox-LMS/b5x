# Boombox content viewer application (b5x-viewer)

b5x-viewer does not yet have full autogenerated documentation, as it has not yet been converted to TypeScript.

No test coverage report is available.

## Responsibilities

The viewer app facilitates most of a user's relationship with Boombox content, so it has many features and responsibilities.

Examples:

- Facilitate the uploading of new or updated topic content
- Allow admins to mass-assign users to groups
- Guide the user through the available content catalog
- Fetch requested content from b5x-api (the Boombox server)
- Render topics and their subcomponents
- Collect input from the user (e.g., responses to any text fields in a topic) and send it to b5x-api for storage
- Collect and display issue reports from users
- Collect and display metrics/feedback from users

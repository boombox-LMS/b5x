# Logging in and out

<breakout title="Test placeholder">
These tests aren't very important until Okta auth is implemented, but they're included so they aren't overlooked later.

For now, you can just check them off as long as you are able to log in and log out, even if you have to manually go to the login page after logout, or the home page after login, rather than being automatically redirected.
